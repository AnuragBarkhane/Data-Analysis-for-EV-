# ELECTRIC-VEHICLE-DATA ANALYSIS(Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
# Project Objective
The primary objective of Electric Vehicle (EV) Data Analysis is to extract meaningful insights from vehicle-related datasets to support data-driven decision-making in areas such as performance optimization, user behavior analysis, energy efficiency, charging infrastructure planning, and market trends. This analysis helps stakeholders—including manufacturers, policymakers, and consumers—understand the operational patterns, identify bottlenecks, forecast demand, and improve the overall ecosystem of electric vehicles.

# KPI’S Requirement

1. Total Vehicles:
Understand the overall landscape of electric vehicles, encompassing both BEVs and PHEVs, to assess the market's size and growth.
2. Average Electric Range:
Determine the average electric range of the electric vehicles in the dataset to gauge the technological advancements and efficiency of the EVs.
3. Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles:
Identify and analyze the total number of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) in the dataset.
Calculate the percentage of BEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, providing insights into the dominance of fully electric models.
4. Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles:
Identify and analyze the total number of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) in the dataset.
Calculate the percentage of PHEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, offering insights into the market share of plug-in hybrid models.


# Charts Requirement

1.Total Vehicles by Model Year (From 2010 Onwards):
Visualization: Line/ Area Chart
Description: This chart will illustrate the distribution of electric vehicles over the years, starting from 2010, providing insights into the growth pattern and adoption trends.

2. Total Vehicles by State:
